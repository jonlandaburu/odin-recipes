        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Before cooking, discard mussels with cracked or broken shells, as well as those with open shells that do not close when you tap them. Heat the oil in a pan with a tight-fitting lid and add the celery and celery salt; cook over a gentle heat for 4 to 5 minutes until softened but not brown. Add the Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well, then tip in the prepared mussels and tomato juice; bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes until the mussel shells have opened. Discard any mussels that haven't opened fully during the cooking process.</li>
            <li>Divide between warmed bowls and scatter with chopped parsley. Serve hot with crusty bread for mopping up the delicious juice.</li>
        </ol>
